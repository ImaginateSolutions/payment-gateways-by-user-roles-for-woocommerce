Set user roles to include/exclude for WooCommerce payment gateways to show up.

== Description ==

**Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce** plugin lets you set user roles for payment gateways to show up.

For your WooCommerce store for each payment gateway you have two options to choose from:

* Set **included user roles** - payment gateway will be available *only* to selected roles.
* Set **excluded user roles** - payment gateway will be *not* available to selected roles.

Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce supports **custom user roles** as well present on your WooCommerce store.

You can also choose which user role must be considered for rule check - either the first assigned user role or all the roles assigned to the user.

With this plugin you can set user roles for four standard WooCommerce payment gateways: Direct bank transfer, Check payments, Cash on delivery and PayPal. To set user roles for all other payment gateways you will need [Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce Pro](https://imaginate-solutions.com/downloads/payment-gateways-by-user-roles-for-woocommerce/) plugin version.

[Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce Pro](https://imaginate-solutions.com/downloads/payment-gateways-by-user-roles-for-woocommerce/) supports almost all the payment gateways created for WooCommerce including Stripe for WooCommerce and [Custom Payment Gateways](https://imaginate-solutions.com/downloads/custom-payment-gateways-for-woocommerce/) created for WooCommerce.

> All I needed was some way to make sure **logged in users (just our admin staff) could take COD payments while Guest users (the general public) could only use credit cards for online payments**. This plugin does that very simply, it’s working perfectly, and I couldn’t be happier!
