Set user roles to include/exclude for WooCommerce payment gateways to show up.

== Description ==

**Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce** plugin lets you set user roles for payment gateways to show up.

For each payment gateway you have two options to choose from:

* Set **included user roles** - payment gateway will be available *only* to selected roles.
* Set **excluded user roles** - payment gateway will be *not* available to selected roles.

With this plugin you can set user roles for four standard WooCommerce payment gateways: Direct bank transfer, Check payments, Cash on delivery and PayPal. To set user roles for all other payment gateways you will need [Payment Gateways by User Roles for WooCommerce Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/payment-gateways-by-user-roles-for-woocommerce/) plugin version.
